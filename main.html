  <b>About Me </b>
  <hr>
<ol>

       <p> I am a PhD candidate at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Auburn University. I started my Ph.D. from August 2018. In 2022, I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Auburn University. I completed my B.Sc. degree at Electrical & Electronic Engineering Department, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in Sep. 2017. From Nov. 2017 to June 2018, I worked as a Lecturer at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh Army University of Science and Technology.</p>
        
       <p> My research interests include communication networks, information theory, machine learning, reinforcemnet learning, multi-armed bandits, and information freshness. My Ph.D. work started a new research area called "Remote Inference," a crucial part of Next-G wireless networks. I developed a novel information-theoretic tool to evaluate the importance of information freshness on remote inference and designed low-complexity optimal scheduling algorithms. Our algorithms have the potential to reduce inference errors by 10,000 times. </p>
       
       <p> I contributed to AI for Agriculture interdisciplinary and cross-university education and research between Auburn University and Tuskegee University, by mentoring a junior Ph.D. student from Tuskegee University, teaching machine learning labs to Auburn and Tuskegee graduate and undergraduate students in the Applied Statistics and Machine Learning course, and leading the research on a USDA project "AI-based Food Demand Forecasting for Alabama Food Pantry" in collaboration with Tuskegee University. </p>
       
       <p> I mentored and co-authored with a high school student from Auburn High School to publish a peer-reviewed journal paper and attend the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in 2023. I also mentored 3 Auburn University Undergraduate Students. </p>
       
       <p>I am maintaining a web page that contains a list of the research papers about the Age of Information, See <a href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~yzs0078/AoI.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> http://webhome.auburn.edu/~yzs0078/AoI.html</a></p>
