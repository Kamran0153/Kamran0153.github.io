    <b>About Me </b>
</font>
  <hr>
<ol>

       <p> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Purdue University working jointly with <b>Prof. Mung Chiang</b> and <b>Prof. Christopher G. Brinton</b> on different areas of communication Networks. Previously, I pursued my PhD at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Auburn University. I was fortunate to have been guided by <b>Prof. Yin Sun</b> as my advisor. My PhD work started a new research area called "Remote Inference" which is a crucial part of Next-G wireless networks. I developed a novel information-theoretic tool to evaluate the importance of information freshness on remote inference and designed low-complexity optimal scheduling algorithms. Our algorithms have the potential to reduce inference errors by 10,000 times. Here is my PhD thesis:  <b><a href="https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/9210" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> Timely Inference over Networks. </a></b> My research interests include communication networks, information theory, machine learning, reinforcemnet learning, multi-armed bandits, and information freshness.  </p>
       
       <!-- <p> I contributed to AI for Agriculture interdisciplinary and cross-university education and research between Auburn University and Tuskegee University, by mentoring a junior PhD student from Tuskegee University, teaching machine learning labs to Auburn and Tuskegee graduate and undergraduate students in the Applied Statistics and Machine Learning course, and leading the research on a USDA project "AI-based Food Demand Forecasting for Alabama Food Pantry" in collaboration with Tuskegee University. </p>
       
       <p> I mentored and co-authored with a high school student from Auburn High School to publish a peer-reviewed journal paper and attend the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in 2023. I also mentored 3 Auburn University Undergraduate Students. </p>
       
       <p>I am maintaining a web page that contains a list of the research papers about the Age of Information, See <a href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~yzs0078/AoI.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> http://webhome.auburn.edu/~yzs0078/AoI.html</a></p> -->
