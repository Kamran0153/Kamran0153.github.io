  <b>About Me </b>
  <hr>
<ol>

       <p> I am a PhD candidate at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Auburn University. I completed my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 2022. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2017. </p>
        
       <p> My research interests include information freshness, wireless networks, semantic communications, and machine learning. My current research focuses on timely inference over communication networks. I have developed an information theoretic tool to interpret the importance of fresh features on timely inference which play crucial role in a wide range of applications such as autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, industrial control systems, and robotics systems. My research has brought novel telecommunication framework and advanced scheduling strategies. </p>
        
        <p> <mark> <b> I am currently on job market. </b> </mark> My thesis overview will be profiled in the December 2023 issue of the ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review (PER) newsletter. </p>
