    <b>Bio</b>
</font>
  <hr>
<ol>

       <p> I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Purdue University, hosted by Purdue President Prof.  <b><a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=171238" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> Mung Chiang</a></b> and Prof. <b><a href="https://www.cbrinton.net" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> Christopher G. Brinton</a></b>. I obtained a Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Auburn University in May 2024 working with Prof.<b><a href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~yzs0078/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> Yin Sun.</a></b> I received IEEE Communications Society William R. Bennett prize (2025) for the paper "Timely Communications for Remote Inference" published at IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking in 2024.</p>
       
       <p>My research interests are in the area of communication networks, machine learning, and multi-agent robotics. With the emergence of AI applications in cyber-physical systems such as smart factories, connected robots and vehicles, and AR/VR, the role of the next-generation communication networks is fundamentally shifting from simply transporting data to executing distributed intelligent tasks. Motivated by this, my research has two intertwined goals: (i) model and optimize communication networks to deliver better performance in real-time inference, online learning, and robotic control and (ii) solve resource allocation problems that arise in the communication networks. Towards this goal, my approach draws upon both classical optimization tools, such as dynamic programming and Lagrangian methods, and machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms.</p>

       <p> PhD thesis: <b><a href="https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/9210" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" action="purge"> Timely Inference over Networks.</a></b></p>
       <!-- <p> I contributed to AI for Agriculture interdisciplinary and cross-university education and research between Auburn University and Tuskegee University, by mentoring a junior PhD student from Tuskegee University, teaching machine learning labs to Auburn and Tuskegee graduate and undergraduate students in the Applied Statistics and Machine Learning course, and leading the research on a USDA project "AI-based Food Demand Forecasting for Alabama Food Pantry" in collaboration with Tuskegee University. </p>
       
       <p> I mentored and co-authored with a high school student from Auburn High School to publish a peer-reviewed journal paper and attend the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in 2023. I also mentored 3 Auburn University Undergraduate Students. </p>
